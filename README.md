# Tips 'n' Tricks Wiki

Simple tips and tricks I use. [Wiki](https://github.com/matijsbrs/Boilerplates/wiki/)

# Code blocks

Code blocks are in the [Programming](https://github.com/matijsbrs/Boilerplates/tree/main/Programming) folder.

It is a random set of (small) pieces of code I collect over time. The goal is to add more as I come along 'handy' code blocks. 

# Tutorials

Most of you will recognize this. You’ve learned how to do something build your project, then 18 months later, a new project needs to be started…Eh… How did I do that?
In trying to prevent this from happening I started making small (technical) tutorials or more step by step guides to get started on stuff.
