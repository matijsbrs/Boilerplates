# BASH
From time to time I use BASH.

## [git.sh](git.sh)
Most of my python projects use the same git tagging, commit ect. 
This tiny script contains the steps in a handy package. 
If it's usefull to you, use it change it share it :wink:

I recommend to add git.sh.old to your .gitignore file. And prevent
a cluttered repository.
